 This script provides a brief overview of the core concepts involved in compilation.
 
 The main purpose of a compiler is to convert source code to machine code.
 
 It does so by reading in source files, and creating an (AST) abstract syntax tree
    which is then parsed and translated into optimized machine code.
 
 The structure of a compiler is as follows: (using the dragon book as a reference)
 
    """each component takes an input and passes the output as the input of the next component"""

    [starts with a character stream that gets passed to the lexical analyzer]
 
    1. Lexical Analyzer -> token stream
    2. Syntax Analyzer -> syntax tree
    3. Semantic Analyzer -> syntax tree
    4. Intermediate Code Generator -> intermediate representation
    5. Machine-Independent Code Optimizer -> intermediate representation
    6. Code Generator -> target machine code
    7. Machine-Dependent Code Optimizer -> target machine code
